 Titanic Dataset â€“ Data Preprocessing Steps
This project focuses on basic data cleaning and transformation of the Titanic dataset:
- Loaded the dataset and viewed basic info like column types and missing values.
- Handled missing data using strategies like mean imputation and mode replacement.
- Encoded categorical features (Sex, Embarked, Deck) into numbers using mapping and one-hot encoding.
- Standardized numeric features (Age, Fare) using z-score scaling.
- Visualized and removed outliers using boxplots and IQR filtering.
This sets up the dataset for future machine learning use.
